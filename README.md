The Beagle Spacial Navigation project is an Arduino program that enables the 
collection of rangefinder sensor data, rotary encoder counts for distance
measurement, and the control of the Beagle robot's motors. It also implements
the robot's dead-man "switch" via a radio receiver.


* Version: 1.0

### How do I get set up? ###

* The program is designed to run on SparkFun's Arduino Pro Micro 5V/16MHz
micro-controller; but will likely run on similar hardware, perhaps requiring 
slight modification.

* The Arduino IDE Version: 1.6.5 is used to compile and load software on the 
target micro-controller specified above.
